## Hola ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex.

I am currently working as a senior software engineer at [@epam](https://github.com/epam), specializing in backend development with Python and Go, mentoring, and leading engineering teams on various projects.

My open-source interests are currently revolving around Rust and Python tooling.

Recently rediscovered some joy in life overall and programming and digging in things in particular yet again (after all this time), so now I'm happy to collaborate on various topics!

Occasionally I commit somewhere.

Alternative spellings (for searching needs): Aleksandr Germ
